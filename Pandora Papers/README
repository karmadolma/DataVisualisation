I recently completed a course on Data Visualization and Information Design: Create a Visual Model by Federica Fragapane and wanted to follow up with my own mini project.

The visualisation is an inspiration from the viz in the course. The visualisation shows the people reported in Pandora Papers with their occupation in 15 countries. These countries were selected based on the highest GDP for the year 2020 except for Russia and Korea (2019).

Brief summary for those who are not familiar with Pandora Papers- When the Pandora Papers were first published, it created an absolute buzz in many countries as they reported secret offshore accounts of many elites in fields like business leaders, former heads of government, ministers and so on from different countries who were using these accounts for tax evasion.

I had no knowledge of adobe illustrator and had to learn how to use it first. For this, I referred to the fantastic free youtube tutorial by Dan Scott who makes learning an absolute pleasure. You can find the tutorial here
